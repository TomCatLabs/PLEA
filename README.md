**PLEA (Prison Labor Exploitation Awareness)** is an open-source initiative committed to increasing transparency around the use of incarcerated labor in the United States. Our mission is to create a centralized platform for documenting, connecting, and escalating issues related to prison labor and other advocacy topics.

This project is maintained by [Tomcat Labs](https://tomcatlabs.com), a grassroots collective focused on ethical technology and data justice.

## Project Goals

- Enable individuals to log and escalate labor-related grievances in prison settings.
- Aggregate decentralized reports into a collective knowledge base.
- Use LLM tools to identify and recommend paths for advocacy or legal awareness.
- Create a scalable model for other advocacy contexts beyond prison labor.
